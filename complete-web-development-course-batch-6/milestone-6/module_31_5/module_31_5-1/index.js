// ES6 Recap and practice with checklist



// 1. You must know when to declare variables with const and when with let. You manually declare a variable with a const and another with a let.
// 2. Create a string with the template string. In that, dynamically set the value of the variable declared above. Similarly declare an object above. And dynamically put the values ​​of the two properties of the above object into your template string.
// 3.1 Declare the arrow function with one parameter. And the work of that function will be if you give any input and divide that input number by 5 and give the output.
// 3.2 You will write an arrow function with two parameters. Inside that function will work. Adds 2 to each input parameter and then multiplies the sum by two. Try to figure out how to do it
// 3.3 Now declare an arrow function with three parameters. The function will take three parameters and multiply those three parameters and return the result.
// 3.4 This time takes an arrow function with two parameters. That arrow function will be many lines. It will add 2 to each input parameter there and then multiply the sum by two. Try to figure out how to do it.
// 4. [Homework] Do a little google search: javascript function declaration vs arrow function then read some articles and try to understand.
// 4.5. What is the difference between var, let, const in JavaScript?
// 5. will be an array of many numbers. Then your work will be using map on the array. Multiply each element by 5 and keep the product as another array. The whole work will be done in one line.
// 6. [ Challenging. Search Google ] Use filter to extract only odd numbers from an array of many numbers
// 7. An array contains many objects. Find the object whose price is 5000 ace with find.
// 7.5 [Extra] What happens with array map, forEach, filter, find in JavaScript. Write a summary of it.
// 8. Simply use destructuring to declare a property of a JavaScript object as a variable.
// 9. [Challenging] destructuring the array and to do that you destructuring the element of the third position of the array and putting it in a variable called 'three'.
// 10. Write a function with three parameters. The function will take three parameters and return the sum of those three parameters. And the third parameter will have a default value. That would be 7.
// [optional]
// 11. Declare a nested object (i.e. the object can be inside the property of an object. And the object can also be inside the property of that object. Declare such an object. And the value of any one property will be an array. Just such object )
// 12. Optional chaining can be done with the question mark before the dot in the object above. Practice it a little.
