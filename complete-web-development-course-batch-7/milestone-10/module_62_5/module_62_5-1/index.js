// Practice Firebase Auth and Private Route for a hotel website



// 0. Decide which project you will practice on. It can be the hotel's website or your own project.
// 1. Go to the firebase console and create a new project. Go there and go to authentication and enable the process that the login system implements.
// 2. Bringing firebase configuration to your project. Create a login button on the website and put the code from the firebase documentation in its event handler.
// 3. Any two authentication systems. I would say: email password plus google or something. That fixes it. Create a context API to implement it in the login component and implement it. What is there in life!!!
// 4. Create a component called PrivateRoute. Rather, check the react router website and understand.
// 5. Use private route.
// 6. Reload on private route should not go to login page
// 7. If the user is not logged in. If want to go private route. Then after taking to the login page. When he logged in, he wanted to go to the route. Will take it there.
// 8. Host your project on Firebase and create a live site.
// 9. Password shoule be uppercase, lowercase, special character, digit and 8 characters.
// 10. Show show and hide password.
// 11. Must have forget password button.
