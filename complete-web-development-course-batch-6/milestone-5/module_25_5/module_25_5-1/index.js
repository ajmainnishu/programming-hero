// Revise HTML5 tags, basic JS concepts and Dom events



// 1. A new script file will open. Can you connect it to index.html?
// 2. Can you select all the elements that have h2 tags and change the text color to light blue?
// 3. That website has a section with backpack ID. Can you change the background color of that section to tomato?
// 4. Can you make the border radius of the card 30px in all the places where the card class is used?
// 5. Write any function. Inside that will be the console log. And add that function to a button as a click handler
// 6. Add an event handler like this to the buy now button. So that if any buy now button is pressed, it will be removed from the website. Try to think a little.
// 7. At the very bottom there is a thing called LET'S STAY IN TOUCH. There you will disable the submit button. Then if someone writes exactly the word email in the above input field. Then the button will be active. And if you write something else then the button will not be active.
// 8. (Optional) A fun challenge. If you mouseenter on an image, that image will change. Do a little google search. How can things be done?
// 9. (Optional) If you double click on an empty space below that has LET'S STAY IN TOUCH, the color behind it will change.
