// DOM manipulation checklist and a practice challenge



// 1. Don't watch our video by yourself and do the bank of father. If possible do as in module 27. And if you can't do it like module 26. But the challenge is that you can search on Google if you want. But can't see our video. Then you'll be stuck coding. Your learning is to stop and finish one thing after 2-3 hours. A developer is made by sweating through these frustrations.
// 2. I gave a practice of a discount calculator. do that Where a price is written and there is a button. Clicking on it will reduce the price by 30%. This will be a slightly more advanced version. On the day you click on the Apply button, if DOM is written in the text box next to it, then the discount will work. Price will drop by 30%. And if not write DOM write something else. Like say dom or drum or something. Then the discount won't work.
// 3. Search on Google. JavaScript calculator. You will see one type of site. Each person is coding in one way. That doesn't matter. the way you like it That way find out and understand. Don't close your eyes. Rather understand. Will be useful in the future.
