You’ll also need a jam jar dressing of your choice.

The first way to make your beurre blanc is to pour the flavoured wine through a sieve into a metal bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of water on a very low heat, whisk, and add the cubes of butter one at a time, whisking them in until all the butter has been used. The sauce will emulsify and look like a very loose custard. Use the beurre blanc immediately or keep whisking it over your pan of water. If you leave it too long, the sauce may split. The second way, and this is my favourite, is to pour some boiling water into a Thermos flask to preheat and clean it. Pour the water away and then sieve the flavoured wine into the thermos, adding all of the butter. Put the lid on tightly, place a tea towel over the lid and shake the thermos around for a few minutes. Open it very carefully (in case of any hot steam escaping) and you should have a nice beurre blanc sauce. The best thing about this method is that you can keep it in the flask and it will keep warm until you’re ready to serve the food."

Once you’ve mastered this recipe, you can take the soup in different ways by adding pearl barley, dried pasta, or some chopped smoked bacon. Even the smallest amount of dried porcini. PS I made this in my pressure cooker the other day, with really great results – it’s so quick! Put a very large saucepan on a medium heat and pour in a couple of lugs of olive oil. Add the sage leaves and fry for around 30 seconds or until dark green and crisp. Quickly remove them with a slotted spoon to a bowl lined with kitchen paper – you’ll use these for sprinkling over at the end moved here. In the pan you’ll be left with a beautifully flavoured oil, so put it back on the heat and throw in your onion, celery, carrot, garlic, rosemary leaves, chilli and a good pinch of salt and pepper.

I know regular alfredo is also super simple and only takes about 15 minutes too, but this is the kind of recipe where you throw everything in a pot, set it and forget it."

                "cooking_method": "Pots de Creme is a thick and rich pudding that's baked and served chilled. This one uses earl gray tea in addition to chocolate to give it a more fragrant touch. I served it with a Cointreau ( an orange-flavored liqueur) whipped cream. Preheat your oven to 325 Fahrenheit with a rack in the center. Heat cream in a pan over medium with the tea bags fully submerged until the cream is almost simmering. Try to keep them moving, so the tea can infuse the cream. Press and remove the tea bags before adding the chocolate and stirring until fully blended. Mix your yolks with the sugar until smooth, then add your hot cream mixture gradually, whisking together. Set your ramkins or mugs onto a baking pan. Distribute the pudding evenly and then add hot water to the pan until it comes about halfway up the pudding dishes. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the top and edges set. Let cool and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before adding the whipped cream, any desired garnish and serving. This recipe makes about 6 3/4 cup ramkins or 3-4 mugs."

Cover the dough with a damp towel and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, blanch the potato slices in boiling water until just cooked through, anywhere between 1 – 2 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly before drying the slices with paper towels and coating them with a touch of olive oil, a pinch of Italian seasoning and kosher salt."

Cut the layered phyllo into six long rectangles. Place one tablespoon of the goat cheese filling at the base of each rectangle and roll up the phyllo, folding in the sides as you go. Repeat twice more to make 18 rolls total. Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheets and brush the rolls with butter; bake for 10 minutes, or until golden. Serve hot with chimichurri rojo for dipping."
